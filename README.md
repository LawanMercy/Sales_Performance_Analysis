### Data Source

The dataset used for this project was gotten from R&S Supermarket, it contained detailed information about sales transactions made by the store.

### Tools
- Microsoft Excel - for data cleaning and transformation, pivot table, data modeling, dashboard.

### Data Cleaning and Transformation

The data was loaded into Excel Power Query, where I performed cleaning and transformation. I checked for null values and errors, and found none in the dataset. I verified the data types for each column, and while most were correct, I changed the data type for the Postal Code and Product ID columns from 'Number' to 'Text'. I also split the Location ID column using the 'Split Column by Delimiter' command, which separated it into two columns. I deleted 'Location ID.2' as it was not needed for the analysis and renamed 'Location ID.1' to 'Location ID'. Finally, I changed its data type to 'Text'.

### Data Modeling
1. I first identidied the entities and attributes.
2. Entities: product, Customers, Location.
3. The Dim Customers was created
4. The facts table contains the measures and the facts about the data.
